				<h3>Game: LUNACY | Year: 2009</h3>
				<p>
					In the 2009 game, LUNACY, robots are designed to pick up 9" game balls and score them in trailers hitched to their opponents' robots for points during a 2 minute and 15 second match. 
					Additional points are awarded for scoring a special game ball, the Super Cell, in the opponents' trailers during the last 20 seconds of the match. 
					"LUNACY" is played on a low-friction floor, which means teams must contend with the laws of physics.
