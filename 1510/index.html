								<h2>Who are the Wildcats?</h2>
								<span class="byline">
									We are 1510, an FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) team based out of Westview High School in Portland.
                                      We have members from a wide variety of schools around the district including Sunset, Mountainside, and ISB.
                                      In this club, students learn a variety of both technical and interpersonal skills that will assist them later in life, from manufacturing and designing to electrical and programming to even business and media.
                                      We incorporate more than just science but also creativity and problem solving to provide an environment for students of all interests. You don't need to just be interested in engineering to join the Wildcats, we have a position for everyone. Inclusivity is one of our top priorities and our team members come from all over. Our team is a great place to start your robotics journey.

										<h3>Computer-Aided Design</h3>
										<p>Every engineering career requires you to know CAD or Computer Aided Design. This is the ability to design the object on the computer so that other people can replicate it. On our team, the CAD students design and create the robot digitally so that the whole team can build the robot based on that. </p>
